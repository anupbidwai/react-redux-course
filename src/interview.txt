What are the features of React?
Ans: Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic 
web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, 
where coding often gets complex very quickly. Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster.

What is JSX?
Ans: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML markup inside a JavaScript file.

Can web browsers read JSX directly?
Ans: No, JSX files cannot be read directly by browsers, a JSX file needs to be converted using JSX transformers into a 
JavaScript object before it can be loaded into the browser and used in the pipeline.

What is VDOM?
Ans: VDOM: https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom

Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?
Ans: Because of its virtual DOM implementation and rendering optimizations, React outperforms Angular. 
It's also simple to switch between React versions; unlike Angular, you don't have to install updates one by one.
